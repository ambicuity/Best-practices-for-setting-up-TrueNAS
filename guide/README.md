## ⚡ Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Hardware**: Compatible server or desktop computer
- [ ] **Storage**: At least 2 drives (4+ recommended for resilience)
- [ ] **Network**: Ethernet connection and router access
- [ ] **Time**: 4-8 hours for basic setup, more for advanced configurations
- [ ] **USB Drive**: 8GB+ for TrueNAS installer
- [ ] **Backup**: Existing data backed up elsewhere

## 🛡️ Safety First

> **⚠️ Important**: This guide will format drives and potentially modify network settings. Always backup existing data and have a recovery plan.

### Safety Checklist:
- [ ] Back up all existing data
- [ ] Have console/local access to the system
- [ ] Know your network configuration details
- [ ] Have recovery media prepared
- [ ] Test in a lab environment first (recommended)

## 🎯 Best Practices Highlights

This guide follows TrueNAS best practices developed by veteran engineers:

### Golden Rules:
1. **Prefer TrueNAS SCALE** for new installations (actively developed)
2. **Boot on mirrored SSDs** (≥60GB each) for reliability
3. **RAM first, cache later** - 16GB minimum for app workloads
4. **Uniform VDEVs** for optimal pool performance
5. **Datasets for boundaries** - separate by use case and permissions
6. **Never expose Web UI to Internet** - use VPN for remote access
7. **3-2-1 backup strategy** - multiple copies, multiple media, off-site
8. **Automate maintenance** - SMART tests, scrubs, and monitoring
