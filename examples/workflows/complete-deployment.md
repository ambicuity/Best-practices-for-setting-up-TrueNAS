## 🚦 Phase 1: Planning & Requirements (Coordinator Agent)

### 1.1 Requirements Gathering
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) documenting:

**Basic Home Setup Requirements:**
```yaml
target_environment: home_office
users: 4-6 family_members  
capacity: 8TB_usable
performance: gigabit_network_limited
availability: single_node_acceptable
backup_strategy: 3-2-1_methodology
security_level: standard_home
budget: moderate
```

**Use the Framework:**
```bash
# Create issue from template
gh issue create --template truenas-task.yml \
  --title "Deploy Basic Home TrueNAS Setup" \
  --assignee coordinator-agent
```

### 1.2 Architecture Decisions  
The Coordinator Agent makes key decisions:
- **Platform**: TrueNAS SCALE (active development, apps ecosystem)
- **Storage**: RAIDZ1 pool (4x4TB drives, 1-drive fault tolerance)  
- **Networking**: Single NIC, VPN for remote admin
- **Backup**: Local snapshots + cloud replication
- **Security**: Firewall, SSH keys, no public web UI

### 1.3 Agent Assignment
```yaml
phase_1_agents:
  - coordinator: overall_orchestration
  - storage: pool_and_dataset_design  
  - systems: boot_and_os_configuration
  - network_security: access_control_and_hardening
```

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Basic Deployment

### 2.1 Systems Engineer: Boot and Base OS
**Responsibilities**: Hardware setup, TrueNAS installation, user management

**Deliverables:**
```bash
examples/basic-home-setup/
├── ansible/
│   ├── bootstrap.yml        # User setup, SSH hardening
│   └── inventory/hosts      # Target system configuration  
└── specs/
    └── users-groups/family.yaml  # User and group definitions
```

**Execution:**
```bash
# Deploy base system configuration
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/hosts ansible/bootstrap.yml

# Validate base system
ssh john@192.168.1.100 "systemctl status"
```

### 2.2 Storage Engineer: Pool and Dataset Design  
**Responsibilities**: ZFS pool topology, dataset hierarchy, performance tuning

**Deliverables:**  
```bash
specs/
├── pools/home-pool.yaml     # RAIDZ1 configuration  
└── datasets/family-data.yaml # Dataset hierarchy with ACLs
```

**Key Decisions:**
- **Pool Type**: RAIDZ1 (3+1 parity, good capacity/performance balance)
- **ashift**: 12 (4K sectors for modern drives)
- **Compression**: LZ4 (fast with good ratio)
- **Recordsize**: Tuned per workload (128K default, 1M for media)

### 2.3 Network/Security Engineer: Access Control
**Responsibilities**: Network configuration, firewall, VPN readiness

**Deliverables:**
```bash
specs/
├── network/home-network.yaml   # Network and firewall config
└── shares/family-shares.yaml   # SMB/NFS share definitions  
```

**Security Implementation:**
- UFW firewall with local network access only
- SSH key-based authentication  
- SMB/NFS shares with proper ACLs
- VPN-ready configuration for remote admin

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Storage Provisioning (Storage + Performance Engineers)

### 3.1 Deploy Storage Configuration
```bash
# Create ZFS pool and datasets
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/hosts ansible/provision.yml

# Verify pool health
ssh john@192.168.1.100 "sudo zpool status tank"

# Check dataset layout
ssh john@192.168.1.100 "sudo zfs list -r tank"
```

### 3.2 Performance Validation
The Performance Engineer validates the storage configuration:

```bash
# Test sequential I/O
ssh john@192.168.1.100 "sudo fio --name=seq-write --ioengine=libaio --rw=write --bs=1M --size=1G --filename=/mnt/tank/fio-test"

# Test random I/O  
ssh john@192.168.1.100 "sudo fio --name=rand-rw --ioengine=libaio --rw=randrw --bs=4k --size=1G --filename=/mnt/tank/fio-test"

# Network throughput
iperf3 -c 192.168.1.100 -t 60
```

### 3.3 Performance Tuning
Based on results, apply optimizations:
```bash
# ARC tuning (adjust for available RAM)
echo "options zfs zfs_arc_max=$((8 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024))" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/zfs.conf

# Network optimizations  
echo 'net.core.rmem_max = 134217728' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```

## 🔧 Phase 4: Services and Applications (Apps/Services Engineer)

### 4.1 Core Services Configuration

```bash
# SMB/CIFS for Windows/Mac
systemctl enable --now smbd nmbd

# NFS for Linux clients  
systemctl enable --now nfs-server

# SSH with security hardening
systemctl enable --now ssh
```

### 4.2 Application Readiness
Prepare for common home applications:

**Nextcloud Setup:**
```bash
# Create app dataset
sudo zfs create tank/apps/nextcloud
sudo chown nextcloud:apps /mnt/tank/apps/nextcloud  

# Install Nextcloud (example)
# (Actual installation varies by method)
```

**Plex Media Server:**
```bash  
# Create media app dataset
sudo zfs create tank/apps/plex
sudo chown plex:apps /mnt/tank/apps/plex

# Link to media share
sudo ln -s /mnt/tank/shared/media /mnt/tank/apps/plex/media
```

## 🛡️ Phase 5: Backup Strategy (Backup/DR Engineer)

### 5.1 Implement Backup Configuration
**Deliverables:**
```bash
specs/backup/home-backup.yaml  # Comprehensive backup strategy
```

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Configure automatic snapshots
sudo systemctl enable --now zfs-auto-snapshot.timer

# Set up cloud backup (Backblaze B2 example)
rclone config create b2-backup b2 account <account> key <key>

# Schedule cloud sync
echo "0 6 * * * rclone sync /mnt/tank/home b2-backup:truenas-home-backup/home --log-file /var/log/backup.log" | sudo crontab -
```

### 5.2 Backup Validation  
```bash
# Test backup functionality
./tests/verify-backup.sh --host 192.168.1.100

# Verify 3-2-1 methodology:
# 3 copies: original + local snapshots + cloud backup  
# 2 media: local ZFS + cloud storage
# 1 offsite: cloud backup
```

## 📊 Phase 6: Monitoring & Observability (Observability Engineer)
